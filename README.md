# 0x1D. C - Binary trees
<hr>

## Description
A binary tree is a data structure that is made up of nodes. Each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the l child and the r child. A binary tree can be used to store data in a hierarchical manner, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. Binary trees are commonly used in computer science for a variety of tasks, such as storing data in a sorted order, implementing efficient search algorithms, and more.

## Learning Objectives

* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Usage

* All files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on gcc 4.8.4 \
using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All files were linted for syntax and style with [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty)
